-- Uer Permission -- 
-- This table will hold the permission levels we will be using in our project 
-- a permission needs an access level , the name of the program name , and the 
-- program names codename. Because access levels will determine what GUI is called 
-- only the access level needs to be a primary key

-- User --
-- The user table will store all the users of the XamineRIS system.

-- patient --
-- the patient table will store all our patients of the XamineRIS system.
-- Each patient needs a unqiue patientID (only visible to the staff) and the 
-- Doctor who referred them for imaging. These two conditions will make the primary

-- who referred them. The username of the refferring dr is suffiecient as both
